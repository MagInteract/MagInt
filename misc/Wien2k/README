The output of the nn program of Wien2k ( case.outputnn )is used to define lattice vectors for which intersite interactions will be calculated by MagInt. 

Some additional information needs to be included into case.outputnn to make it compatible with MagInt. 
To add it please copy the  patch file  nn.patch to the nn source directory SRC_nn and apply the patch as follows:

>cp nn.patch $WIENROOT/SRC_nn
>cd $WIENROOT/SRC_nn
>patch nn.f nn.patch
>make
>cp nn ..
